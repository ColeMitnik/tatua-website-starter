Our Story

### Content
Founded in 2020 by former enterprise support leaders, Tatua was born from frustration with outdated ticketing systems. We've processed over 2 million support tickets and helped companies reduce response times by an average of 45%.

After experiencing the pain of managing support operations at scale, our founders knew there had to be a better way. Traditional ticketing systems were slow, inflexible, and created more problems than they solved.
